      <p><strong>How much does laundry cost?<br></strong>Washing machines and dryers are located within each apartment in Ackell Residence Center, Broad &amp; Belvidere Apartments, Cary &amp; Belvidere Apartments, Grace &amp; Broad Residence Center, West Grace North Student Housing, and West Grace South Student Housing. All other residence halls have laundry rooms within each building for residents to utilize for their laundry needs, at no cost to them. Each laundry machine is operated with a swipe of the VCUCard, which Residential Life &amp; Housing loads with money at the beginning of each semester, and is reloaded as it is depleted.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve a washing machine in Honors, Brandt, Rhoads, Johnson, Gladding Residence Center and Cabaniss</strong></p>

<p><strong>Printers<br></strong>VCU has an extensive wireless network that uses particular frequencies and channels to function. Unfortunately, most wireless printers broadcast the same frequencies and channels, and disrupt our signal when their wireless function is turned on. If you have a printer that has wireless capabilities, please turn the printer's wifi off. Wireless printers, when the wifi is enabled, will cause mobile devices such as your laptop and cellphone to disconnect from VCU's wireless network. The printer's signal can also travel through floors and walls and cause your neighbors' devices to lose their wireless connections as well. If you are not sure how to turn off your printer's wireless signal, please call ResNet Student Support for assistance at (804) 828-8943.</p>

      <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>VCU recognizes the importance of sustainability for our quality of life today and for future generations, and protecting the limits of natural systems. In April 2008, VCU’s President Emeritus Eugene P. Trani, Ph.D., signed the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment, joining more than 600 college and university presidents in a commitment to neutralize greenhouse gases emitted on their campuses. As a signatory, VCU is working to reduce emissions in all areas of campus life — from educational programs and facilities to dining and residential life — as part of its plan to become climate-neutral by 2050. Read the University’s Statement of Sustainability and see how the University as a whole is working toward its goal at&nbsp;<a href="https://sustainability.vcu.edu/"><span class="s2">sustainability.vcu.edu</span></a>.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>How Can I Be More Sustainable As I Prepare To Come To Campus?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put CFL or LED light bulbs into desk, table, and floor lamps. One CFL or LED bulb should be able to last you throughout your college career, provided you turn it off when you leave the room.</li>
<li>Pack as much as possible into suitcases when you’re packing for your new hall, instead of using plastic bags or cardboard boxes. When you’re done unpacking, send all suitcases back home with Mom &amp; Dad, with the exception of one suitcase for your trips home.</li>
<li>Ask for used cardboard boxes at your area grocery store, instead of purchasing new.</li>
<li>Check out area thrift stores for décor for your new room, like lamps, posters, picture frames, throw pillows, or even rugs.</li>
<li>Check with roommates before buying appliances and electronics so you don’t purchase multiples, and consider renting your microfridge from Melvin Corporation, instead of purchasing appliances you won’t need after move out.</li>
<li>Borrow a vacuum cleaner from the Housing office in your hall, instead of purchasing your own.</li>

      <p>If you see a pest in your building, please report it via the work order system at <a href="https://quikfm.vcu.edu/">Quikfm.vcu.edu</a>. Be as specific as possible when completing the work order, with the location, type of pest, and how many were noticed. Our pest control contractor will respond within 1 business day to inspect the area and treat as needed. If a more intensive treatment is necessary, instructions will be provided on how to properly prepare your living space for treatment, and the treatment will be scheduled to coincide with that preparation.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>If you are locked out of your room during office hours (Monday – Friday, 8am – 6pm), visit your hall’s Housing Office to borrow a key for a maximum of 30 minutes. If you are locked out after hours or on weekends, visit the information desk in your hall, and the desk assistants will contact the RA on call to meet you in the lobby and escort you to your room to unlock the door. Please note that the first two lockouts after hours are free. The third lockout of the semester results in a charge of $30 being placed on your student account.</p>
<p><strong>Keys<br></strong>Residence hall keys are the sole property of VCU and may not be duplicated under any circumstances. Possession of residence hall keys is limited to students with valid housing contracts. Room and mailbox keys are issued directly to the student assigned to a room, and are not transferrable. Roommates cannot pick up keys for one another.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Keys<br></strong>If you have lost your keys, you may borrow a long-term loaner key for a maximum of 3 days. If you have not found your keys and returned the loaner key by the end of the loan period, your room will be rekeyed, you will be issued a new room key, and your student account will be charged $65 for a room key. If you have also lost your mailbox key, you will be charged an additional $20 for a new mailbox key</p>

      <h3>Heat and AC</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>Many students wonder if they can change their unit from AC to heat. The answer is yes, but only in some buildings. Rhoads, Cabaniss, and Johnson were built with a two-pipe HVAC system, meaning that the building can either run heat or air conditioning, but not both. In Brandt Hall and the Honors College, while the buildings allow for heat and air conditioning simultaneously, it is necessary for the boilers to be taken out of service in the summer and the chiller to be taken out of service in the winter, in order to be more sustainable, and to provide routine maintenance to the systems. Facilities Management and Residential Life &amp; Housing staffs pay close attention to the changes in the weather, and using forecasts, determine the best date to switch from one system to the other. Students will be notified ahead of time when the change over is going to occur.</p>
<p>HVAC filters are changed at each unit on a quarterly basis. Depending on your building, filter changes may happen during breaks when your building is closed, or they may happen during the semester.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>Fire/Safety inspections are performed in all residence halls during the Fall and Spring semesters by the Virginia State Fire Marshall’s Office and the VCU Office of Environmental Health &amp; Safety. Resident rooms are inspected to ensure compliance of State Fire Code, as well as compliance with VCU and Residential Life &amp; Housing (RLH) Fire/Safety policies, for the safety of all residents living on campus. During each visit, necessary corrections are made by Fire officials and RLH staff, including confiscation of prohibited Fire/Safety items. Residents found in violation of the Fire/Safety policies may face judicial action. A full list of prohibited items can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://housing.vcu.edu/media/housing/documents/2017-18GuidetoResidentialLiving.pdf">2017-18 Guide to Residential Living (Housing Policies) </a>.</p>

      <h3>Facility FAQs</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p><strong>Are Phone Lines Provided In The Residence Halls?</strong></p>
<p>Landline telephone connections are no longer provided in students' rooms within the VCU residence halls. Students therefore should not bring their own landline telephone. However, "courtesy" landline phones will be available throughout each hall. If a student wishes to use a courtesy phone for a long-distance call, he or she will need to provide their own calling card.</p>
<p><strong>What To Bring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alarm clock and desk lamp</li>
<li>Pillows, blankets and bed linens for an extra-long twin bed (Ackell &amp; Broad &amp; Belvidere residents should bring bedding for a full bed)</li>
<li>Bath linens, toiletries, shower caddy and shower shoes</li>
<li>Your favorite fish, in a 10 gallon or smaller tank</li>
<li>Flashlight</li>
<li>Iron and ironing board</li>
<li>Surge protectors with on/off buttons</li>
<li>Microwave, mini fridge, TV with QAM tuner, gaming systems (check with your roommate so you only bring one of each!)</li>
<li>Plants, posters, wastebasket, mirror (except Johnson Hall)</li>
<li>Non-flammable curtains</li>
</ul>
<p>Students living in suite-style residence halls should also bring toilet paper, toilet plunger, and bathroom cleaning supplies. Students living in apartment-style residence halls should also bring dishes, kitchen utensils, pots and pans, toilet paper, shower curtain, toilet plunger and kitchen and bathroom cleaning supplies. We recommend that students contact their future roommate(s) about possible duplication of items prior to arrival on campus. Only one microwave and mini fridge is allowed per bedroom.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>What Not To Bring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional furniture – wait until you have seen your room and how much space you have before bringing an extra chair. All VCU-provided furniture must remain in its assigned room. Non-VCU mattresses are not permitted without permission from Student Accessibility and Educational Oportunity.</li>
<li>Loft materials (construction of loft beds is prohibited) or cinder blocks to raise beds (only designated bed risers are permitted)</li>
<li>Personal air-conditioners or space heaters</li>
<li>Landline telephones (courtesy phones are located in each building)</li>
<li>Pets that are not fish</li>
<li>Extension cords and items that require a flame to operate or that produce heat, such as candles (including decorative), incense and incense burners, plug-in air fresheners, grills, lanterns and halogen lights (a full list of prohibited fire/safety items can be found in our&nbsp;<a href="https://housing.vcu.eduhttps://housing.vcu.edu/media/housing/documents/2017-18GuidetoResidentialLiving.pdf">policy manual</a></li>
<li>Illegal drugs, fireworks, chemicals, firearms and weapons of any kind. Students are expected to abide by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Do I Do If The Outlet(S) Beside My Sink Aren’t Working?</strong></p>
<p>If the GCFI outlet near the sink is not working, it has likely surged and needs to be reset. You can reset the outlet by pressing the “Reset” button at the center of the outlet. Note: If the cause of the surge has not been corrected, the outlet will stop working again. You will need to unplug the appliances or remove the water causing the surge before continuing.</p>

      <h3>Room Change</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>Students interested in seeking a change in room assignment should seek out the Hall Director of their current building. Typically, the Hall Director's office is located on the first floor of the building and, except in emergencies, students will be required to make an appointment. Most Hall Directors will want to discuss with you reasons for your desired room change. If a roommate conflict is taking place, he/she may offer mediation assistance or other guidance to assist you. When a room change seems appropriate for any reason, the Hall Director is able to go on-line and view available vacancies across campus, which he/she will discuss with you. Once a new room has been selected, you will receive an official room change email from the Housing Office, confirming the change and giving you a time frame (typically three (3) days) to complete your move. Room changes will be processed based on space availability.</p>
<p>Our goal is for students to be happy and comfortable in their residence hall assignment and we understand a variety of reasons may warrant consideration of a room change. While we may offer assistance with solving a current roommate problem or direct you to campus resources for other types of support, our goal will always be to help you create or seek a safe, supportive and comfortable living environment.</p>
<p>Please note that room rates vary depending on the specific residence hall, suite, or apartment. Differences between housing rates will be prorated, effective on the date the new assignment is made. Room changes can also result in changes in dining plan status. Please be sure to request information regarding the impact a room change may have on your housing rate or meal plan requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any questions regarding your move should be directed to the appropriate area office or our central Housing Office.</p>
